Online frontend code editors, such as CodePen, are web-based platforms that allow users to write, test, and share HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets. These editors provide an easy-to-use interface with syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and live previews of the code being written.

CodePen and similar platforms offer various features like the ability to collaborate with others on a project, save and share code snippets publicly or privately, and access a library of pre-built components and templates. These platforms also allow users to experiment with different code libraries and frameworks and quickly prototype ideas without needing to set up a local development environment.

Additionally, CodePen and similar platforms have become popular resources for learning and sharing frontend development techniques, with many developers using them to showcase their work and share knowledge with others.
